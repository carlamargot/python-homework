In this assignment we explored with different parameters and training steps to make our LSTM models more accurate. 


I found that my LSTM - RNN model had a better loss overtime and that it was a better predictor of the actual closing values over time. 
Based on my experimentation with the models, I found that the a three day window reduced the most loss. 

Here is an image of both results:
